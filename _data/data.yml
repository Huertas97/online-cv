          In my MSc I got the opportunity to discover my interest in statistic, data analysis and machine learning. Bioinformatics is a ever-evolving field full of breathtaking 
          researches.  
          I passed several subjects with Honours: 
          - MACHINE LEARNING course
          - TEXT MINING course
          - CHARACTERIZATION OF NETWORKS AND BIOLOGICAL TOPOLOGIES course
          - RESEARCH SEMINARS course 

          
    - degree: BSc in Biotechonology
      university: University of Salamanca
      time: 2015 - 2019

        In this study we aimed to elucidate the use of state-of-the-art deep learning approach based on semantic level
        and NLU techniques to infer and understand information from texts to tackle infodemic and misinformation
        for COVID-19

    - role: MSc Final Project Student
      time: 2019 - 2021
      company: Department of Computer Engineering (UAM) and Computer System (UPM)
      details: |
        Automatic information search for waging COVID-19 misinformation through semantic similarity. Since COVID-19 emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 the
        public have been bombarded with vast quantities of information. Much of which is not checked. There is no doubt that public health emergencies are stressful 
        times for people and communities. The abundance of information on social media frequently without any check on its authenticity makes it difficult for an individual to distinguish between facts and opinions, propaganda, or biases. 
        Our belief is that information should be accessible across all the globe and languages spoken should not be a hurdle. Consequently, in this study, we aimed to elucidate the use of multilingual state-of-the-art deep learning models based on semantic 
        level and NLU techniques to infer and understand information from texts to tackle infodemics misinformation.
